# Web-Forum
This project is basically like a discussion board(a forum). The whole idea is to maintain several boards, which will behave like categories. Then, inside a specific board, a user can start a new discussion by creating a new topic. In a particular topic, other users can engage in the discussion post and further carry forward the discussion by posting replies.
